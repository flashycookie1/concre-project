        Each year, it is the teamâ€™s challenge to assess and evaluate competition
        regulations and adhere to them throughout the engineering design
        process. This includes designing, planning, testing, constructing, and
        finalizing. At the end of the process, the team kicks into competition
        mode where we deliver an in-depth design paper, give a panel
        presentation, and race and compete against other teams in our canoe.
